No firmware volume header present
No valid firmware volume was found

The variable store has not been found in the ROM image
and is about to be initialized. This situation is normal
for a release image, as the variable store is usually
initialized on the first boot of the platform.

Successfully created variable store in "/home/macpijan/projects/github/dasharo/dcu/test/data/work/novacustom_nv4x_adl_v1.6.0.rom"
Successfully set variable SerialRedirection in the variable store.
